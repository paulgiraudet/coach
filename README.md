Here is a website where we had some rules to respect.

Wireframes needed to be validated by the customer before any line of code and there was 5 colors only to include.

No one page, 4 distinct pages with a homepage, an info page, a prices page and a contact page.

A slider in the home page, a table in the prices page, a diary and a map in the contact page were mandatory.

This work was done as part of the YesWeWeb formation.
